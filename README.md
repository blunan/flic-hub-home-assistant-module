# Home Assistant Utils
Here you will find some utils I use in Home Assistant to make my home smarter.

## Flic Hub Module
This module for your Flic Hub uses the [Flic Hub SDK](https://flic.io/flic-hub-sdk) to connect Flic Buttons with Home Assitant using their [REST API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest).

## Seismic Sensor
A command line sensor for Home Assistant that checks for earthquake alerts and returns the earthquake's magnitude, location and date.
